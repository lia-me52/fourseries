# Fourier Transform and Series Visualization

## Description

This project provides a Python implementation of the Fourier Transform and Series, along with a visualization of periodic and aperiodic functions. 
The code uses NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib to generate the functions and plot them. Additionally, it uses PyAudio to play a sample sound wave.

## Features

- Implementation of the Fourier Transform and Series
- Visualization of periodic and aperiodic functions
- Playback of a sample sound wave using PyAudio
- Customizable parameters for the functions and plots

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- PyAudio

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fourier-transform-visualization.git
